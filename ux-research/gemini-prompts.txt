# Gemini Deep Research Prompts for Starview UX Research
# Created: 2024-11-28
# Purpose: Gather user pain points, competitive intelligence, and market positioning data
# Usage: Copy each prompt into Gemini Deep Research and save outputs to this directory

================================================================================
PROMPT 1: USER PAIN POINTS FROM COMMUNITIES
================================================================================

Perform deep research on user pain points and frustrations related to finding stargazing and astrophotography locations. Focus on:

**Primary Sources:**
- Reddit communities: r/astrophotography, r/astronomy, r/darksky, r/telescopes, r/landscapeastrophotography, r/spaceporn
- X/Twitter discussions about stargazing locations
- Astronomy forums (Cloudy Nights, Stargazers Lounge)
- App store reviews for astronomy apps

**Research Questions:**
1. What are the most common complaints when people try to find dark sky locations?
2. What do astrophotographers wish they knew BEFORE driving to a spot?
3. What information do users say is missing from existing apps/tools?
4. What unexpected problems do people encounter at stargazing sites (safety, access, terrain, crowds)?
5. How do beginners differ from experienced stargazers in their needs?

**Output Format:**
- Categorize pain points by theme (discovery, planning, on-site, social)
- Include direct quotes where possible
- Rate frequency (how often each pain point appears)
- Note any feature requests users explicitly mention


================================================================================
PROMPT 2: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Perform comprehensive competitive analysis of apps and websites in the stargazing/dark sky location space.

**Research Scope:**
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android) for finding stargazing spots
- Websites with dark sky maps or location databases
- Astrophotography planning tools
- Light pollution mapping tools
- Weather/clear sky forecast apps used by astronomers

**For Each Competitor, Analyze:**
1. Core value proposition - what problem do they solve?
2. Key features and functionality
3. Pricing model (free, freemium, subscription)
4. User reviews - what do people love/hate?
5. Target audience (beginners vs serious astronomers)
6. Content model (user-generated vs curated vs automated)
7. Mobile experience quality
8. Community features (if any)

**Key Competitors to Include:**
- Dark Site Finder
- Light Pollution Map (lightpollutionmap.info)
- Clear Outside / Clear Dark Sky
- Stellarium
- PhotoPills (astronomy features)
- SkySafari
- Star Walk
- Any location-based stargazing review platforms

**Output Format:**
- Competitive matrix comparing features
- Gap analysis - what's missing in the market?
- Positioning opportunities for a new entrant


================================================================================
PROMPT 3: MARKET POSITIONING & DIFFERENTIATION
================================================================================

Research the stargazing and astrotourism market to identify positioning opportunities for a web app focused on user-reviewed stargazing locations.

**Research Areas:**

1. **Astrotourism Trends**
   - Growth of dark sky tourism
   - Demographics of stargazers (age, location, experience level)
   - Seasonal patterns and popular destinations
   - Connection to camping, hiking, and outdoor recreation

2. **Underserved Segments**
   - Who is NOT being served well by existing tools?
   - What use cases are poorly addressed?
   - Geographic gaps (which regions lack good resources?)

3. **Emerging Needs**
   - Impact of Starlink/satellite visibility concerns
   - Growing interest in astrophotography among beginners
   - Light pollution awareness movements
   - Dark sky preservation advocacy

4. **Successful Patterns from Adjacent Spaces**
   - What made AllTrails successful for hiking?
   - How does iNaturalist build community around observations?
   - What can be learned from Yelp/TripAdvisor for reviews?

**Output:**
- 3-5 potential positioning statements for a stargazing location app
- Unique value propositions that differentiate from competitors
- Target audience personas with specific needs


================================================================================
NOTES FOR FUTURE REFINEMENT
================================================================================

These prompts can be refined based on:
- Specific geographic focus (US-only, international, specific regions)
- Target audience narrowing (beginners only, astrophotographers only)
- Feature-specific research (e.g., deep dive on weather integration needs)
- Temporal focus (recent discussions only, historical trends)

When Starview evolves, consider adding prompts for:
- Feature validation (testing specific feature ideas with community sentiment)
- Pricing research (what are users willing to pay for?)
- Accessibility research (how do users with different needs engage?)
- Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
